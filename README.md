# Google-Clone

Tech: ReactJS, React Router, Context API, Firebase, Material UI

My attempt at cloning Google's Home and Search page. 
Willing to add more pages in the future.

Details: 
1. Used Context API to manage state and its flow.
2. Material UI for Google icons and basic styling. 
3. React Router for routing purposes 
4. Used Google's custom search API for fetching live information from Google, based on the searched term.
5. Made a custom hook to fetch data from API. 
6. Used firebase to setup the app, connect it to Google and finally deploy it.


Instructions:
1. Git clone the file.
2. Run 'npm install' in the terminal at the file directory.
3. Finally run 'npm start' to start the app at your localhost.
