# Google-Clone

My attempt at creating a google clone with home and search page. Might add more pages in the future.

Details: 1.Context API 2.Material UI for icons and basic styling. 3.React Router for routing purposes 4.Used Google's custom search API for fetching live information from google based on searched term 5.Made custom hook 6.Used firebase to setup the app, connect it to google and finally deploy it.
